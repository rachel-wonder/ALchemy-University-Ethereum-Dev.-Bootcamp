## Alchemy University: Ethereum-Dev.-Bootcamp
This repo is my web3 portflio to complete the assignment from Alchemy University-Ethereum-Dev.-Bootcamp.

**7** week project in total.

### Weekly Content Breakdown üìù
The Ethereum Developer Bootcamp content is intended to build on itself week after week. Here is a rough outline of what to expect week-to-week:

#### Week 1

We first start by covering cryptography fundamentals. What are hash functions? What makes them special? How are they important to blockchains? Then, with the context of having learned cryptographic primitives like hashing, we dive into what makes blockchains work: consensus mechanisms. Basically, how the heck do decentralized networks agree on what is what. Week 1 ends with a project for the weekend: using what you learned over the week to create a secure public-private key server.

#### Week 2

In this week, we start covering some of the data structures used to make blockchains work, mainly lots of trees! We also compare the UTXO model that Bitcoin uses to keep track of balances versus Ethereum's Account-based model.

#### Week 3

This is the first week where we take a break from the heavy computer science fundamentals covered in Week 1 and Week 2 (cryptography, p2p networks, data structures, etc) and finally start to focus on Ethereum. We cover the difference between read and write requests and how these requests are sent/received (back as responses) using the well-known JSON-RPC interface loaded up on the standard Ethereum node.

#### Week 4

We cover smart contract fundamentals (why are smart contracts cool?) as well as how to program them using Solidity.

#### Week 5

Further mastery of the Solidity language.

#### Week 6

Further mastery of the Solidity language. Advanced concepts covered.

#### Week 7

Exploration of smart contract use cases, using applications like Aave, Uniswap and Chainlink to deepen learning and gain inspiration for student projects. At this point, students should be starting to ideate their own projects. on
